            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi I'm Ayaan Patel. A certified geek by heart(and by genetics). I go to Ridge High School and am in the 9th grade. I am also a content creator, front stack developer(for now), cross country and track kid, a muslim, and all around your average guy. I also play video games, go to the gym, play airsoft, and much more. You may be thinking I do this because my parents force me to but that's not true even though I do have indian parents. But nope, just the curiosity of a young kid.</p>
